Course and Year: BSCS-3

Through this activity, I learned that Git is a version control system that helps track changes in a project, 
while GitHub is an online platform that stores and manages Git repositories. I understood how Git allows me to
 record my progress, undo mistakes, and collaborate with others by using commands like init, add, commit, and push.
 I also learned how GitHub makes it easy to share my code online, keep it safe, and work with others on the same 
project efficiently. Overall, I gained practical experience in managing and publishing my work using Git and GitHub
